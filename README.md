Academic Achievement

Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to predict academic achievement in secondary education(high school) of two Portuguese schools. This project explores the external factors that may support or hinder academic achievement.

Student Peformance

This data approach student achievement in secondary education of two Portuguese schools. The data attributes include student grades, demographic, social and school related features) and it was collected by using school reports and questionnaires. Two datasets are provided regarding the performance in two distinct subjects: Mathematics (mat) and Portuguese language (por). In [Cortez and Silva, 2008], the two datasets were modeled under binary/five-level classification and regression tasks. Important note: the target attribute G3 has a strong correlation with attributes G2 and G1. This occurs because G3 is the final year grade (issued at the 3rd period), while G1 and G2 correspond to the 1st and 2nd period grades. It is more difficult to predict G3 without G2 and G1, but such prediction is much more useful (see paper source for more details).(UCI, December 2024.)

Methodology

Machine Learning:using machine learning models to analyze historical data. This allows data professionals to predict or make decisions without knowing the final outcome. Academic Achievement (project) will use the logistic regression and decision tree models.

Model Analysis:Logistic regression-using features, it applies a linear relationship between features (independent variables) and targets.

Decision Tree: Root Nodes: entire dataset and splits based on feature significance. Internal Nodes: decision based on features and decision splits the dataset into smaller subsets. Branches: connect nodes and showcase the outcomes. Leaf nodes: terminal node to the final prediction.

Feature Analysis: features are independent variables used in the model.

Data Visualization: creating graphs and other visualizations to show the logistic and decision tree models/features.
